# ðŸ¦¾ J.A.R.V.I.S. - Iron Manâ€™s Digital Assistant (Inspired Project)

## ðŸ§  Project Overview

In the Marvel universe, **J.A.R.V.I.S.** (Just A Rather Very Intelligent System) is Tony Stark's AI assistant. It's a highly advanced artificial intelligence that helps Iron Man with nearly every aspect of his life: flying his suit, defending his base, managing communications, and handling day-to-day tasksâ€”all through natural voice conversations.

This project is a Python-based voice assistant inspired by J.A.R.V.I.S. It leverages speech recognition and synthesis libraries to create a basic command-line assistant that can:

- Operating the application through voice
- Play music or videos on YouTube
- Answer general questions using Wikipedia
- Search queries on the web
- Interact with the system (open applications like system commands or web commands)
- Send messages, make a phone call or video call through your whatsapp
- Send messages, make a phone call through your mobile
- Additional features like recording video, taking a selfie and taking notes through your mobile
